
CSV is a simple file format used to store 
tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. 

They mostly use the comma character to separate 
(or delimit) data, but sometimes use other 
characters, like semicolons. 

You can also open CSV files in spreadsheet 
programs, which make them easier to read.
