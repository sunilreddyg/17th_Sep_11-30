Collection : Root interface with basic methods like add(), remove(), 
             contains(), isEmpty(), addAll(), ... etc.
 
Set : Doesn't allow duplicates. Example implementations of Set 
      interface are HashSet (Hashing based) and TreeSet (balanced
      BST based). Note that TreeSet implements SortedSet.

List : Can contain duplicates and elements are ordered. Example
       implementations are LinkedList (linked list based) and
       ArrayList (dynamic array based)

Queue : Typically order elements in FIFO order except exceptions
        like PriorityQueue.  

Deque : Elements can be inserted and removed at both ends. Allows
        both LIFO and FIFO. 

Map : Contains Key value pairs. Doesn't allow duplicates.  Example
      implementation are HashMap and TreeMap. 
      TreeMap implements SortedMap.        

The difference between Set and Map interface is that in Set we 
have only keys, whereas in Map, we have key, value pairs.
